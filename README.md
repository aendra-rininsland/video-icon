# Video Link Icon*

This is a Chrome extension to put a little icon (courtesy the amazing [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/))
next to links to video sites. This list is configurable via the Options page.

## Usage

Because it's not yet in the Chrome store, it's a little bit more involved to get
going with this. Download the package as a zip [here](https://github.com/aendrew/video-icon/raw/gh-pages/video-icon0.0.10.zip) and extract.

Visit [Chrome Extensions page](chrome://extensions/) and click the "Load unpacked extension"
button. Click the "Options" link to the newly-installed extension to configure.
At the moment, only YouTube and Vimeo are in the list by default — in the future,
I plan to add a function to easily add a site to the list, likely via an icon in
the omnibox. Note that the value of each line in Options is a regular expression — specifying
simply "youtube" matches youtube.com, youtube.co.uk, etc.

## Todo

+ Publish to Chrome Store
+ Create omnibox icon to facilitate adding new sites.
+ Figure out a less-shitty name for this thing.
